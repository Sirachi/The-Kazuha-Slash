    <h1> Kazuha's Ult</h1>
    <h2 >By Sidd Sajan</h2>

    <p>
      Kazuha's ult has to be by far one of my personal
      favorite ults in the whole game. It's so unique
      and its name is just simply amazing. It's very 
      helpful for anemo reactions. This with a 
      4 piece virdersent venerer set of artifacts,
      which can actually decrease the enemy's resistance
      to the elemental that was swirled. For example, if 
      I use my keqing's first e skill which creates a lighting
      mark in front of her, it applies the enemy with electro.
      Then using kazuha's ult and/or e skill, you can swirl 
      electro which in turn activates the artifact effect and 
      then decreases the enemy resistance to electro by
      around 40%.(Damn imagine actually reading all this, 
      like how bored are you? Go outside or something, smh)
      Then switching back to keqing and activating 
      her second e skill in which she teleports to the lighting
      mark, she can do increased dmg.
